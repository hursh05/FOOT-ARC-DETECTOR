# FOOT-ARC-DETECTOR

## Overview

The Foot Arch Analyzer project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze foot arch images and classify them into different categories. The model is trained to recognize features in foot images that indicate whether the arch is normal, flat, or high. The tool can be used to assess foot health, design custom orthotics, or provide guidance for athletic footwear.

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Architecture

The neural network architecture used for foot arch classification includes:

Input Layer: Accepts input images of a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).

Convolutional Layers: Several convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.

Pooling Layers: Max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.

Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers for final decision-making.

Output Layer: A softmax layer for classification into three categories (normal, flat, high).

The model is trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.


Results and Evaluation

Training and Validation Accuracy:

The training process logs accuracy and loss over several epochs.

The results are visualized to detect potential overfitting or underfitting.

Confusion Matrix:


Displays the classification performance across the three categories.

Helps identify areas where the model may struggle (e.g., distinguishing flat vs. high arch).

Classification Report:

Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Example Predictions:


Visualize a few test samples and the model's predicted classification.

Future Enhancements

Expand Dataset: Increase the diversity and size of the dataset for better model generalization.


Model Optimization: Experiment with deeper architectures or other machine learning techniques for improved accuracy.

Real-Time Analysis: Implement real-time foot arch analysis using a webcam or mobile device.

Integration with Mobile Apps: Create a mobile app that uses the trained model for foot arch analysis on-the-go.
